Analysis of the data sets from the paper 'The dominance, prestige, and leadership account of social power motives' by Suessenbach et al.

Original data and analysis scripts available at: https://osf.io/uxtq2/

Original academic article at: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/per.2184

This (re)-analysis was carried as part of an assignment from an MBA course on leadership. Due to the limited scope of this assignment, it is recommended to look directly at the analysis of the original paper, and also the freely available R scripts. The Python code here should merely be seen as a potential compliment to the original work.
